# Pico-KiCAD

The **DebugProbe** project aims to re-imagine Raspberry Pi Debug Probe.

## Anke (Debug Probe)

**Anke** is a 4-layer board intended to accommodate the popular Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU with all required component to function identically to Raspberry Pi Debug Probe. The board is pin-compatible with Raspberry Pi Debug Probe and can be used with the same picoprobe SW.

Features:

- Very small form-factor of about 25x40mm.
- Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU as a heart of the board.
- USB Type-C connector for power and communication.
- Several LEDs to indicate power and status.
- BOOTSEL button to enter the bootloader mode for flashing new picoprobe SW.
- Pin-compatible with Raspberry Pi Debug Probe.

## Bernd (RGB Panel ECU)

Bernd is a 4-layer board intended to drive 4x2 RGB Panels each consisting of 64x64 Pixel.

Features:

- Very small form-factor of about 60x60mm.
- Raspberry Pi RP2350B MCU as a heart of the board.
- USB Type-C connector for power and communication.
- BOOTSEL button to enter the bootloader mode for flashing new picoprobe SW.
